➡️ What: Pyments: How To Design Payment Applications In Python
📢 Who: Alvaro Duran
⏱ Duration: 30 minutes
👅 Language: English
🧐 Abstract: "Payments are a massive part of how the world works. But most engineers know very little about it. That’s sad, because, as more and more of business happens online, there’s an increasing demand for payment applications that are scalable, and maintainable. Besides, Python is a great programming language to build payment applications! It is very interoperable, has a thriving open source community, and even non-engineers can contribute significantly to software built with it. In payments, readability counts, too!
In this talk, we’re going to dive deep into how to build money software effectively. You’ll learn why Python and payments are a match made in heaven, and how to leverage the language to build your own payment applications, in-house, fast, and effectively. That way, you’ll cut some intermediaries in the process, saving your company a lot of money. It is no wonder why software engineers that can build payment applications are in high demand, they can point to their code and say “that prints money”."
